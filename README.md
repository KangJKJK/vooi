I have written a script to make it easier for Koreans to use the bot from the source

Source= https://github.com/codenewinsight/VOOI-Telegram-Bot-backed-by-Binance

Run a bot

wget -O soniclabs.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KangJKJK/soniclabs/refs/heads/main/soniclabs.sh && chmod +x soniclabs.sh && sudo ./soniclabs.sh
